            "Real Paper Abstract": "Establishing correspondences across images is a fundamental challenge in computer vision, underpinning tasks like Structure-from-Motion, image editing, and point tracking. Traditional methods are often specialized for specific correspondence types, geometric, semantic, or temporal, whereas humans naturally identify alignments across these domains. Inspired by this flexibility, we propose MATCHA, a unified feature model designed to \"rule them all\", establishing robust correspondences across diverse matching tasks. Building on insights that diffusion model features can encode multiple correspondence types, MATCHA augments this capacity by dynamically fusing high-level semantic and low-level geometric features through an attention-based module, creating expressive, versatile, and robust features. Additionally, MATCHA integrates object-level features from DINOv2 to further boost generalization, enabling a single feature capable of matching anything. Extensive experiments validate that MATCHA consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across geometric, semantic, and temporal matching tasks, setting a new foundation for a unified approach for the fundamental correspondence problem in computer vision. To the best of our knowledge, MATCHA is the first approach that is able to effectively tackle diverse matching tasks with a single unified feature.",

Conventional techniques often cater to specific types of correspondences\u2014whether geometric, semantic, or temporal\u2014whereas humans excel in recognizing alignments across these diverse domains. Drawing inspiration from this inherent versatility, we introduce MATCHA, a comprehensive feature model designed to address a wide array of matching tasks. Building on the understanding that diffusion model features can capture multiple correspondence types, MATCHA enhances this capability by dynamically integrating both high-level semantic and low-level geometric features through an attention-driven mechanism, yielding robust, flexible, and expressive features. Furthermore, MATCHA incorporates object-level features from DINOv2 to further enhance its generalization ability, enabling a single feature representation to match across various tasks. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MATCHA consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches across geometric, semantic, and temporal matching challenges, establishing a new benchmark for unified solutions to the fundamental correspondence problem in computer vision.

                "Abstract": "Recent advancements in deep learning have propelled its application in computational linguistics, enabling the identification of complex patterns within textual data. This research examines the distribution of word classes specific to individual authors through part-of-speech (POS) tagging and bigram analysis. By utilizing deep neural networks, we categorize literary authors according to POS tag vectors and bigram frequency matrices extracted from their works. Our investigation employs both fully connected and convolutional neural network models to assess the effectiveness of unigram and bigram-based representations. The findings indicate that while unigram features provide moderate classification accuracy, the use of bigram models yields a notable improvement, suggesting that the sequential nature of word class patterns is a stronger indicator of an author's style. Visualizations through multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) further illustrate the meaningful clustering of authorial works, reinforcing the idea that stylistic characteristics can be captured through computational techniques. These results underscore the promise of combining deep learning with linguistic feature analysis for author profiling and literary research.",

Copyright claims and Author identification are deemed crucial as there has been a considerable amount of increase in content violation owing to the lack of proper ethics in society. The Author's attribution in both English and Romanized Sinhala became a major requirement in the last few decades. As an area largely unexplored, particularly within the context of Romanized Sinhala, the research contributes significantly to the field of computational linguistics. The proposed author attribution system offers a unique approach, allowing for the comparison of only two sets of text: suspect author and anonymous text, a departure from traditional methodologies which often rely on larger corpora. This work focuses on using the numerical representation of various pairs of the same and different authors allowing for, the model to train on these representations as opposed to text, this allows for it to apply to a multitude of authors and contexts, given that the suspected author text, and the anonymous text are of reasonable quality. By expanding the scope of authorship attribution to encompass diverse linguistic contexts, the work contributes to fostering trust and accountability in digital communication, especially in Sri Lanka. This research presents a pioneering approach to author attribution in both English and Romanized Sinhala, addressing a critical need for content verification and intellectual property rights enforcement in the digital age.",

Among these, the issues of copyright infringement and author identification have become increasingly significant due to the surge in content violations driven by widespread ethical concerns. The need for accurate author attribution, particularly in the contexts of English and Romanized Sinhala, has gained substantial importance in recent decades. This area remains relatively underexplored, especially within Romanized Sinhala, and this research makes a notable contribution to the field of computational linguistics. The proposed system for author attribution offers a novel approach by comparing only two distinct text sets: one from the suspected author and the other from an anonymous source. This contrasts with traditional methods, which often rely on analyzing larger text corpora. The approach utilizes numerical representations of pairs of texts from the same or different authors, enabling the model to train on these representations rather than raw text. This allows the system to be applicable across various authors and contexts, provided the texts in question are of sufficient quality. By broadening the scope of authorship attribution to include diverse linguistic contexts, the study plays a vital role in promoting trust and accountability in digital communication, with a particular focus on Sri Lanka.

            "Real Paper Abstract": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting is a dominant paradigm in Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance complex reasoning. It guides LLMs to present multi-step reasoning, rather than generating the final answer directly. However, CoT encounters difficulties when key information required for reasoning is implicit or missing. This occurs because CoT emphasizes the sequence of reasoning steps while overlooking the early extraction of essential information. We propose a pre-prompting method called Iterative Summarization Pre-Prompting (ISP^2) to refine LLM reasoning when key information is not explicitly provided. First, entities and their corresponding descriptions are extracted to form potential key information pairs. Next, we use a reliability rating to assess these pairs, then merge the two lowest-ranked pairs into a new entity description. This process is repeated until a unique key information pair is obtained. Finally, that pair, along with the original question, is fed into LLMs to produce the answer. Extensive experiments demonstrate a 7.1% improvement compared to existing methods. Unlike traditional prompting, ISP^2 adopts an inductive approach with pre-prompting, offering flexible integration into diverse reasoning frameworks. The code is available at this https URL.",

In this study, we collected blood samples from three MYH9-RD patients (R702S, D1424N, and R1464C) and unexpectedly found that the actin levels in the red blood cells (RBCs) from all three MYH9-RD patients are substantially lower than the healthy controls. We further revealed that the levels of two RBC membrane skeleton proteins, \u03b1-spectrin and tropomodulin, are also reduced in MYH9-RD RBCs. We showed that the membrane skeleton of MYH9-RD RBCs was more porous and that MYH9-RD RBCs produced more severe deformation under hyperosmotic pressure compared to healthy controls.

Pigs are an important reservoir in influenza ecology because they serve as a mixing vessel in which novel reassortant viruses with pandemic potential can be generated. Here, we show that oro-respiratory infection of pigs resulted in productive replication of a bovine-derived HPAI H5N1 B3.13 virus. Infectious virus was mainly identified in the lower respiratory tract of principal infected pigs, and sero-conversion was observed in most of the principal pigs at later time points.

In response, we introduced GALILEO\u2122, an advanced computational platform integrated with a customizable bioinformatics pipeline and a geometric deep learning algorithm, ChemPrint\u2122, designed for in silico drug screening. Leveraging this platform alongside an extensive chemical repositioning library, we identified MDL-001, a compound that binds to the Thumb pocket 1 subdomain of several single-stranded RNA viruses. We present evidence of MDL-001's strong in vitro activity against a wide array of viral pathogens, as well as its significant in vivo efficacy in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical trials confirm that MDL-001, when administered orally, is both safe and well tolerated.

Our first conjecture asserts the existence of a large number of supersymmetric states which can be thought of as a non interacting mix of supersymmetric black holes and supersymmetric 'gravitons'. It predicts a microcanonical phase diagram of supersymmetric states with eleven distinct phases, and makes a sharp prediction for the supersymmetric entropy (as a function of 5 charges) in each of these phases. The microcanonical version of the superconformal index involves a sum over states - with alternating signs - over a line in 5 parameter charge space. Our second conjecture asserts that this sum is dominated by the point on the line that has the largest supersymmetric entropy. This conjecture predicts a large N formula for the superconformal index as a function of indicial charges, and predicts a microcanonical indicial phase diagram with nine distinct phases.

            "Real Paper Abstract": "While stabilizer tableaus have proven exceptionally useful as a descriptive tool for additive quantum codes, they offer little guidance for concrete constructions or coding algorithm analysis. We introduce a representation of stabilizer codes as graphs with certain structures. Specifically, the graphs take a semi-bipartite form where input nodes map to output nodes, such that output nodes may connect to each other but input nodes may not. Intuitively, the graph's input-output edges represent information propagation of the encoder, while output-output edges represent the code's entanglement. We prove that this graph representation is in bijection with tableaus and give an efficient compilation algorithm that transforms tableaus into graphs. We show that this map is efficiently invertible, which gives a universal recipe for code construction by finding graphs with nice properties. The graph representation gives insight into both code construction and algorithms. To the former, we argue that graphs provide a flexible platform for building codes. We construct several constant-size codes and several infinite code families. We also use graphs to extend the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound to a three-way distance-rate-weight trade-off. To the latter, we show that key coding algorithms, distance approximation, weight reduction, and decoding, are unified as instances of a single optimization game on a graph. Moreover, key code properties such as distance, weight, and encoding circuit depth, are all controlled by the graph degree. We give efficient algorithms for producing encoding circuits whose depths scale with the degree and for implementing certain logical diagonal and Clifford gates with reduced depth. Finally, we find an efficient decoding algorithm for certain classes of graphs. These results give evidence that graphs are useful for the study of quantum computing and its implementations.",

                "Abstract": "Stabilizer tableaus have long served as a descriptive framework for additive quantum codes, yet they offer limited direction for constructing codes or analyzing related algorithms. This work presents a novel approach by encoding stabilizer codes as structured graphs. These graphs adopt a semi-bipartite configuration wherein input vertices are exclusively connected to output vertices, while interconnections among outputs are permitted, and no edges exist between inputs. This structure captures the encoder\u2019s information flow through input-output links, while output-output connections reflect the underlying entanglement in the code. We formally establish a bijective correspondence between such graphs and stabilizer tableaus, and introduce a computationally efficient method to convert tableaus into their graph equivalents. This transformation is also shown to be efficiently reversible, providing a systematic methodology for code synthesis via graph exploration. The graph-based framework offers both conceptual and practical benefits. On the construction side, we demonstrate how this model facilitates the design of compact codes and scalable code families. Leveraging these insights, we extend the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound by formulating a tripartite trade-off among distance, rate, and weight. On the algorithmic front, we reinterpret fundamental procedures\u2014such as estimating code distance, minimizing weight, and decoding\u2014as unified optimization problems over graphs. Furthermore, critical code parameters, including distance, weight, and encoding circuit depth, are governed by the degrees of graph nodes. We present efficient algorithms for synthesizing encoding circuits with depth scaling proportional to node degree, and for implementing logical diagonal and Clifford gates with optimized depth. Additionally, we develop an efficient decoder applicable to specific graph classes. Altogether, our findings highlight the potential of graph representations as a powerful tool for advancing quantum code design and quantum computing technologies.",

This work introduces a novel graphical approach to representing stabilizer codes, wherein codes are depicted as structured graphs exhibiting a semi-bipartite topology. In this formulation, input vertices connect to output vertices\u2014though not to one another\u2014while output vertices may share edges, capturing both information flow and entanglement properties of the code. We formally establish a bijective correspondence between stabilizer tableaus and these graphs and develop an efficient compilation method to convert between the two representations. The invertibility of this mapping enables a general graph-theoretic strategy for constructing quantum codes with desirable features. This graphical representation offers both conceptual and practical advantages. On the design front, we demonstrate the utility of graphs as a flexible medium for code construction, presenting examples of compact codes and extending to infinite code families. Additionally, we leverage the graphical perspective to generalize the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound, introducing a three-dimensional trade-off between code distance, rate, and weight. From an algorithmic standpoint, we unify a range of quantum coding procedures\u2014including distance estimation, weight minimization, and decoding\u2014under the framework of a graph-based optimization problem. Crucial code parameters such as minimum distance, code weight, and encoding depth are directly influenced by the degree distribution of the associated graph. We provide efficient techniques for generating encoding circuits whose depth scales with graph degree and describe implementations of logical Clifford and diagonal gates with improved depth efficiency.

These include patchworks of synonymized contents using paraphrasing tools, featuring tortured phrases, increasingly polluting the scientific literature. The Problematic Paper Screener (PPS) has been developed to allow articles (re)assessment on PubPeer. Since most of the known tortured phrases are found in publications in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), we extend this work by exploring their presence in the humanities and social sciences (HSS). To do so, we used the PPS to look for tortured abbreviations, generated from the two social science thesauri ELSST and THESOZ. We also used two case studies to find new tortured abbreviations, by screening the Hindawi EDRI journal and the GESIS SSOAR repository. We found a total of 32 multidisciplinary problematic documents, related to Education, Psychology, and Economics. We also generated 121 new fingerprints to be added to the PPS. These articles and future screening have to be investigated by social scientists, as most of it is currently done by STEM domain experts.",

However, there is a lack of a systematic evaluation and clear guidelines for optimal methodologies for this task on Reddit, one of today's largest social media. In this study, we fill this gap by comparing state-of-the-art (SOTA) and probabilistic models. To this end, first we collect a novel data set of more than 850k self-declarations on age, gender, and partisan affiliation from Reddit comments. Then, we systematically compare alternatives to the widely used embedding-based model and labeling techniques for the definition of the ground-truth. We do so on two tasks: (i) predicting binary labels (classification); and (ii)~predicting the prevalence of a demographic class among a set of users (quantification). Our findings reveal that Naive Bayes models not only offer transparency and interpretability by design but also consistently outperform the SOTA. Specifically, they achieve an improvement in ROC AUC of up to 19% and maintain a mean absolute error (MAE) below 15% in quantification for large-scale data settings. Finally, we discuss best practices for researchers in CSS, emphasizing coverage, interpretability, reliability, and scalability.

Here, we study how gender participation within different fields is related to gender representation in top-ranking positions in productivity (number of papers), research impact (number of citations), and co-authorship networks (degree of connectivity). We analyzed over 80 million papers published from 1975 to 2020 in 19 academic fields. Our findings reveal that women remain a minority in all 19 fields, with physics, geology, and mathematics having the lowest percentage of papers authored by women at 14% and psychology having the largest percentage at 39%. Women are significantly underrepresented in top-ranking positions (top 10% or higher) across all fields and metrics (productivity, citations, and degree), indicating that it remains challenging for early researchers (especially women) to reach top-ranking positions, as our results reveal the rankings to be rigid over time. Finally, we show that in most fields, women and men with comparable productivity levels and career age tend to attain different levels of citations, where women tend to benefit more from co-authorships, while men tend to benefit more from productivity, especially in pSTEMs. Our findings highlight that while the participation of women has risen in some fields, they remain under-represented in top-ranking positions.
